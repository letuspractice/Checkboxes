# Checkboxes
A Katalon script to check some boxes in a web game

A co-worker discovered a game to check 100 boxes.  https://github.com/Pjmisfit/the-checkbox-game
They mentioned that it would be a good exercise to see if we could create a Katalon script for playing the game.
Turns out it was a bit more challenging since the recording the Katalon made would not play back and click the boxes.
We had to add a selenium feature and java actions to click the boxes.
